RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS<br />

1)	It is basically a piece of code which is intelligent enough to understand what user wants.

2)	Used widely in various platforms.


3) Main ideology behind it is to give better experience to the  users ,give a personalized experience and finally increase the profit of the organization for example YOUTUBE(so that user watches more ads) ,SPOTIFY,NETFLIX,AMAZON(so that user buys more products) etc.

4) TYPES OF RECOMMENDATON SYSTEM:-

a) POPULARITY BASED—e.g Youtube trending section, IMDB top 250 movies     recommendation .In tis system the system does not  acts according to the preference of users but rather shows only the most trending or top products on the platform. Based on some formulas.

b) CONTENT BASED--- Content-based filtering methods are based on the description of a product and a profile of the user’s preferred choices. In this recommendation system, products are described using keywords, and a user profile is built to express the kind of item this user likes.
For instance, if a user likes to watch movies such as Iron Man, the recommender system recommends movies of the superhero genre or films describing Tony Stark.
The central assumption of content-based filtering is that you will also like a similar item if you like a particular item.

c) COLLABORATIVE FILTERING BASED--- The collaborative filtering method is based on gathering and analysing data on user’s behaviour. This includes the user’s online activities and predicting what they will like based on the similarity with other users.
                For example, if user A likes Apple, Banana, and Mango while user B likes Apple, Banana, and Jackfruit, they have similar interests. So, it is highly likely that A would like Jackfruit and B would enjoy Mango. This is how collaborative filtering takes place.
                           One of the main advantages of this recommendation system is that it can recommend complex items precisely without understanding the object itself. There is no reliance on machine analysable content.

d) HYBRID RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS--- In hybrid recommendation systems, products are recommended using both content-based and collaborative filtering simultaneously to suggest a broader range of products to customers. This recommendation system is up-and-coming and is said to provide more accurate recommendations than other recommender systems.
